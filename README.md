# landing-page
I have created a landing page consisting four sections and a footer. the initial section features a headr displaying a log and navigation links, nested within a header body containing a title, sign up button, and an image placeholder. the second section showcases random information with containers waiting images. third section contains an inspiring quote, attributed to an author. the last section entices visitors with a sign up prompt and a call to action. finally, the footer elegantly concludes the page, bearing copyright information.
